# Portfolio version 1 

## Intro 
Version 1 of my portfolio site. Pretty basic no functionality, just wanted to test out how the structure and styles should look. 
Pretty happy with the overall site structure, its simple to use and easy to find everything. 
Pretty happy with the styling as well, it looks pretty clean. Need to add some more texture to background and add some more colour.
The content will also be changed, projects and blog posts added.

## Things to add/improve for next version
- Need to add functionality to site such as light dark theme change, progress bar on top of screen 
- Need to add texture to the background. Thinking of maybe mountains or hills. 
- Need to add more colour to site 
- Need to update and improve content 
- Need to add projects 
- Need to write blog posts 
- Need to move about me to another page 
- Index will contain small introduction paragraph, some projects, and some blog posts
