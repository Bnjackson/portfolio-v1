                </div>
                <p>Hey I'm Benjamin, Welcome to my portfolio site. I am a self taught web developer and programmer
                    based in London. I have worked as a Chef and in customer facing roles, 
                    but am looking to transition into web development. 
                </p>
                <p> Ever since I was young, the world of technology has fascinated me,
                    sparking a curiosity that has only grown with time. From tinkering
                    with gadgets to exploring the latest advancements, 
                    my passion for all things tech has been a constant companion on my 
                    journey. Recently, I decided to take my fascination a step further by
                    delving into the world of programming. 
                    The allure of creating something tangible out of lines of code and 
                    the prospect of contributing to the ever-evolving digital landscape
                    have become irresistible to me. 
                    With each line I write, I am not just learning a new skill;
                    I am fulfilling a lifelong dream of actively participating
                    in the technological innovations that once captivated my imagination.
                    This transition marks the convergence of a longstanding interest with
                    a newfound skill, propelling me into the exciting realm where
                    technology and creativity intersect.
                </p>
                <p>In my current role, I navigate the realms of web development using
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, crafting dynamic and 
                    responsive digital experiences. Embracing the ever-evolving 
                    nature of the field, I've embarked on a journey to delve into 
                    React, enhancing my ability to build scalable and efficient 
                    user interfaces. As I familiarize myself with the React ecosystem, 
                    I am captivated by its potential for creating interactive and 
                    seamless applications. 
                    Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my skill set further by 
                    delving into TypeScript, recognizing its ability to bring a 
                    new level of clarity and reliability to my code. Beyond that, 
                    my roadmap includes exploring additional backend languages, 
                    broadening my proficiency to ensure versatility in tackling 
                    diverse projects. 
                    This commitment to continuous learning reflects my dedication to 
                    staying at the forefront of technological advancements and 
                    delivering cutting-edge solutions in the ever-dynamic landscape of 
                    web development.
